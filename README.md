# SERVER MONO

This repository contains the [source files](https://github.com/internet-development/www-server-mono/tree/main/fonts) for Server Mono and the source code for our website, which is built using our [next-sass-starter](https://github.com/internet-development/nextjs-sass-starter) template system used across all our websites.

Server Mono is a typeface inspired by typewriters, Apple's San Francisco Mono, ASCII art, command-line interfaces, and programming tools.

Server Mono continues the long tradition of monospace fonts, renowned for their versatility in command-line interfaces due to their clear readability and uniform character width. You'll notice our own preferences reflected in the design, as we value how it performs across various viewing contexts. Server Mono offers excellent readability and pairs well with its uniform, predictable, and orderly appearance.

This single-weight font was released in 2024 by the Internet Development Studio Company of Seattle, Washington. Created by designers Tim Vanhille and Matthieu Salvaggio, with supplemental direction from Jimmy Lee and the Internet Development Studio Company community.
